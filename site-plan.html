      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>
        I like fly fishing but I’m an avid fly-tying enthusiast. I’m also
        learning to build websites. What better way to combine these to things
        to create a web site the showcases this rare art form? I want to build a
        site dedicated to sharing the creative and artistic side of fly-tying. A
        place where people like myself can admire these little masterpieces and
        get inspired. This site would also be a place where we could share
        patterns, tips, tricks and techniques to help keep this art form alive.
      </p>

      <!-- ------------------------Steps 4-8------------------------------ -->

      <h3>
        Color Palette
      </h3>
      <!--  The colors you choose for a website are one of the most important decisions you will make. Follow the instructions on the activity in iLearn then return and replace the color codes below with the hex color codes (the 6 digit numbers that show at the bottom of each color) for the colors you have chosen below.  You should have at least 2 colors but do not have to fill in all 4 if you do not need them.  -->

      <!-- Copy and paste the URL to your finished palette below Make sure to paste it into both spots -->
      Palette URL:
      <a
        href="https://coolors.co/1b394b-e7c24f-aabd8c-c1666b-808a9f"
        target="_blank"
        >https://coolors.co/1b394b-e7c24f-aabd8c-c1666b-808a9f</a
      >

      <table class="colors">
        <tr>
          <th>Primary</th>
          <th>Secondary</th>
          <th>Accent 1</th>
          <th>Accent 2</th>
        </tr>
        <!-- Replace the numbers in the boxes below with your hex color codes. Then switch to the site-plan.css file and change your colors there as well. -->
        <tr>
          <td class="primary">#1b394b</td>
          <td class="secondary">#AABD8C</td>
          <td class="accent1">#E7C24F</td>
          <td class="accent2">#DBDBDB</td>
        </tr>
      </table>

      <!-- ------------------------Step 9------------------------------ -->

      <h3>
        Typography
      </h3>
      <!-- Choose a font for your paragraphs (body copy) and headlines. What font(s) have you chosen? Why did you choose what you did?  Make sure to review the list of web safe fonts at W3Schools.org as a starting point.  Think also about which of your colors above you might use for background and font colors. -->

      <h4>
        Heading Font: Amatic SC
      </h4>
      <p>
        I chose Amatic SC as it reminds my of my hand writing and I think it
        adds to the handcrafted feel that comes with fly tying.
      </p>

      <h4>
        Paragraph Font: Oswald 'light'
      </h4>
      <p>
        I chose Oswald 'light' becasue it was a suggested pairing from Google
        Fonts and I think it is easy to read.
      </p>

      <h4>
        Normal paragraph example
      </h4>
      <p>
        The best Whitewater Rafting in Colorado, White Water Rafting Company
        offers rafting on the Colorado and Roaring Fork Rivers in Glenwood
        Springs. Since 1974, we have been family owned and operated, rafting the
        Shoshone section of Glenwood Canyon and beyond.
      </p>
      <h4>
        Colored paragraph example
      </h4>
      <p class="colored">
        Trips vary from mild and great for families, to trips exclusively for
        physically fit and experienced rafters. No matter what type of river
        adventures you are seeking, White Water Rafting Company can make it
        happen for you.
